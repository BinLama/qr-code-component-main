## My process

-   I created the html lookout first while observing both desktop and mobile view.
-   Then, I started with styling the mobile view.
-   Since, mobile and desktop view were the same, I didn't change anything for the desktop view.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use css variables. They made my code look more clean.
I also used non breaking space on html.

```css
:root {
    --DarkBlue: hsl(218, 44%, 2);
}
```

```html
